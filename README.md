HOW DOES IT WORK?

The system works by running a Python script on your PC that uses `psutil` to read the CPU usage and sends it over a USB serial connection to the ESP8266. The ESP8266, connected to an SSD1306 OLED via IÂ²C, receives the value, then updates the display to show the current CPU percentage in real time, repeating the process continuously.
